            <h2>About Our Cause</h2>
            <p>Every year, countless broken devices and trash are discarded improperly. When electronic devices are thrown away, it contributes to e-waste. Pollution comes in three main forms:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Land Pollution</strong> - Waste discarded on land, such as trash and debris.</li>
                <li><strong>Water Pollution</strong> - Contaminants like plastics that pollute our oceans and rivers.</li>
                <li><strong>Air Pollution</strong> - Harmful gases and toxins released into the air, including those from e-waste.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>When e-waste is improperly disposed of, rusted and broken electronics release toxic substances into the environment, affecting air quality.</p>
            <h2>How Can We Stop This?</h2>
            <p>We can reduce e-waste by recycling, selling old electronics instead of discarding them, and using platforms like Jawa to repurpose gadgets. This helps keep our environment clean and protects us from radiation and toxins.</p>

            <h2>Our Research Questions</h2>
            <h3>How electronics are made and what resources they use?</h3>
            <h4>A summary of what we found out:</h4>
            <p>We found out that electronics are made by using an automated and manual procces. What I mean by this is that most of the stuff (like the carving of the bronze motherboards which is done by a robot) and the other part is getting made by humans (like heating the wrap around it) there are some electronic parts that get completely made by robots (like Printed Circuit Boards or PCBs for short). Mostly electronic parts are made by Finite Recources of non-renewable resources like lead or bronze or tin which means that if we keep using these resources they will eventually run out and cause a problem.<p>
            <h3>How e-waste and pollution from electronics affect animals and the planet?</h3>
            <h4>A summary of what we found out:</h4>
            <p>We found out that e-waste can add air pollution and land pollution and this ia a very concerable problem in the world and it has to get fixed. It affects animals and the planst by the pollution part and the waste part. On land pollution  animals can stumble across and think of the waste as food and eat the waste which gets them sick and they eventually (by the uncurable sickness) they unfortunatly die. But they affect the planet by polluting the air. As we said above when electronics get broken or rusted they release toxins which leads to air pollution and makes a hole in the ozone layes (protects us from the UV Lights of the sun and is located on the sky) if that layer gets damaged and we get exposed from it we will die to the radiation of the sun.<p>
            <h3>Ways to reduce the negative impact of electronics on the environment</h3>
            <h4>A summary of what we found out:</h4>
            <p>We found a lot of ways to reduce the negative impact of electronics on the environment. They are for what you guys can do! As above at the section that says "How can we stop this?" there is a part that says that if you have any broken devices sell them as scrap to other companies or websites and this part is very important because it a win-win because it helps you to get rid of the toxins that you have in your house and they also pay you for it and they also recycle the usable parts from the electronic device/s and put them into other devices wich helps them, our planet and you guys.</p>
